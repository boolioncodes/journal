title: "I'm not happy with Liquid or Github's web interface"
---

I've been working in GitHub Pages for awhile, but with this current project I'm encountering some new things,
and let me tell you friends, I am *not* happy about it.

Let's start with the easy one before I describe the more difficult one.

**GitHub's web interface has *no* way to revert back to a previous commit**.  
Now you're probably thinking *"well just use the command-line, duh"*.

Come here.

*It's a **really** important feature*  
*If we don't **need** it on the website, then we simply **don't need a website at all***  
It's not dumb to want a *revert* feature, it's dumb to produce a fragment of the feature-set without *revert*.

I mean, they literally could have made the GitHub site entirely read-only because that would prevent you from doing
things using the web interface that you can't undo.

Thankfully, I didn't make a big mess this time.  I wanted to undo a teeny-tiny change and I had to do it manually.

I'm disappointed for bigger reasons.  Previously I would have suggested *"it's possible to edit your files on
the website, so you can do it anywhere such as from your phone!"*  But if someone can't revert, now that seems like
**terribly reckless** advice so I need to think differently about GitHub.

Oh, but wait, there's more!

I'm getting more hands on with Jekyll and trying to write some Liquid templates and let me tell you, (*whistles*)
..I do **not** like Liquid.

There's a common thread here today of nerfed, broken, crippled technology and Liquid is like the main boss.

At first it reminded me of `jq` but that's not a compliment. I find `jq` awful to work in, but lately I think `jq`
would feel refreshing to work in after this.

So let's talk about what's bothering me:  I can't determine the type of a variable.  The docs of Liquid basically
think I should already know the type because a.) I made the variable, or b.) I'm using an API and the API tells me
what it should be.

However, I'm trying to write something that walks through a tree taking different actions for arrays and objects
and primitives ( strings, numbers, booleans ).  My template needs to take any kind of input and branch appropriately.  
See my trouble?

I found [a discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38917552/check-if-variable-is-type-of-string-or-array-in-liquid) 
that says I should use the `first` property because arrays and objects have them, but primitives don't.

...but later on in the same discussion they say **strings will return the first character** when you use `first`.  
This is a new feature that broke the old tactic of detecting strings.

Great work, boys.

The discussion mentions using square bracket syntax with index zero `[0]` but this didn't work for me.  I need to
do more testing, but this *might also* be returning a character from the string, and if so...

But wait. There's more.

Objects are handled *so screwy* by Liquid.  They act kinda sorta like arrays within arrays.  
A key-value pair are a 2-element array with a string in the first element.  
It seems as though Liquid *knows* the difference, but I can't find how it behaves any differently in any way
other than letting me use the key to retrieve the value.  That feature requires that I know the key in advance,
which I don't when I'm traversing a whole tree.   So in terms of what I can do with iteration, it's just "like"
nested arrays.

*sigh*

Ok, so the score as I have it now is that I can kinda sorta barely tell objects and arrays apart, though that
part isn't working in my template, and I'm still uncertain if I can tell primitives from arrays because 
(second verse, same as the first) that part isn't working in my template either.

Next thing for me to do is more debugging by outputing a lot of values at every step of the recursive template.  
For example, what is `first`, what is `[0]`, what is `[0][0]`, and so on.

I think it would be wise to make a table with columns as properties and rows as nodes.

```
  node  |  `first`  |  `[0]`  |  `[0][0]` |  etc  ...  |
 (top)  |           |         |           |            |
 (next) |           |         |           |            |
 (...)  |           |         |           |            |
```
Oh, and I *just* learned that GitHub Flavored Markup doesn't do tables.   
Because who would ever need to format the output of data?
