title: "default GH Pages theme: lies, damned lies, and documentation"
---

***Well***, after a bunch of sleuthing I finally discovered what the *default* theme is in GitHub Pages.  
All the documentation I found said that it is **Minima** but it turns out that is not true.

I didn't even know that I wasn't using Minima until I tried to use the Minima documentation to make a change
to my site's appearance and it didn't work.   In the process of trying to troubleshoot the issue, I explicitly
set the theme to `minima` and at that point the appearance changed noticeably -- but not the change I was seeking. 
This was a hint that something was going on.

There's a [2+ year old post on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68518590/does-minima-dark-skin-work-on-github-pages) 
discussing my issue and it says that the copies of themes stored and used by GitHub Pages are out-dated.
I suspected that this was my problem -- not a different theme, but an out-dated theme.  

However, this same post links to a [status page from GitHub Pages with version numbers of all the components used
by GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/versions/) and this page seems to indicate that it's up-to-date with the
Minima theme.  So I kept looking for other explanations.

I captured source code of this journal with `theme: minima` set and without it set.   Then I did a side-by-side diff 
of the source to focus on the parts that change.   Though nothing really significant jumped out at me, I found what
looked like some "unique" code that may help me identify this theme.  And.. eventually it did!

The code in question was this:

```html
 <body>
    <div class="container-lg px-3 my-5 markdown-body">
```

Specifically, I used that `markdown-body` class because it seems like the base class that others are used together with
so I thought it might be most likely to appear in documentation.

A search yielded documentation of [a Jekyll theme called **Primer Spec**](https://eecs485staff.github.io/primer-spec/). 
The interesting thing is that Primer Spec looks *similar* enough to what's being used by this journal, 
but also different enough that I didn't have an "a ha!" moment.   I kept digging.

I looked back at the source code and found [a script called *anchor.js*](https://www.bryanbraun.com/anchorjs/#examples)
that adds anchor (`<a>`) elements into the page.   Interesting, but ulitimately unhelpful; although I searched for 
themes using anchor.js, this didn't uncover anything useful.

What finally helped was continuing to scour the page of **Primer Spec** and uncovering the [**README** file](https://eecs485staff.github.io/primer-spec/README.md), 
which says:

> Primer Spec is built on top of the wonderful [Primer theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer) ...

I opened up the **Primer** theme and *boom*, [that's it](https://pages-themes.github.io/primer/).

**The default theme used GitHub Pages is *Primer*, not *Minima* as all other documentation would have you believe**
