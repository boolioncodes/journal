Congratulations! You've reached the first post.

Here are some simple patterns you can expect to find in this sub-site, <code>{{ site.baseurl }}</code> :

* **chronological** order is the basic founding organization   
  everything in one big stream, sorted by date
* **posterity** is the biggest motivation for the journal
* things that would appeal to a wider audience such as **organization**, **completeness**, and pleasing visuals,
  require **a new shell project** that can *reference* this content
