title: "phone's battery status over ssh"
---

I mentioned earlier that I've been working with my **Pinephone** and it's been unplugged from power for a bit,
so I wanted to know what the battery was doing but I didn't want to wake up the screen.

So I found out how to check the battery status from the console.

The following capture of my console was done over ssh, which means all of this is available over a network 
without even being near the phone.
