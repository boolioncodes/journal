title: "exporting a bookmarklet"
---

I have two profiles on my Chromebook and they both have a bookmarklet that I use often.  
However I didn't copy-paste the bookmarklets from one account to the other.  (Well not yet)  
I wrote and rewrote the bookmarket.  And the newer one is way better.

So what I'm doing today is finally copying the newer one.

I've exported my bookmarks into HTML, trimmed down the file to just the part I want, and saved it in a gist:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/boolioncodes/99b1318cf65bbc1ac317d8ec98f7ca39.js"></script>

Next I'll open this very journal entry, grab the file, and import it into my browser.

The bookmark code isn't terribly easy to read, so here's a prettier version of the source:

```javascript
(function () {
    var bdy = document.body,
        obg = getComputedStyle( bdy ).backgroundColor,
        nbg = "rgb(" + /(?<=\().*(?=\))/g.exec(obg)[0].split(", ").map(x=>(x^255)).concat("0.8").join(", ") + ")";
    Object.assign( bdy.style, {
        backgroundColor : nbg ,
        filter: "invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg) brightness(0.8) contrast(0.8)"
    } );
    console.log("user dark-mode applied");
})()
```

However, this code above is **not bookmarklet ready**.  It must be **URI escaped** and receive a `javascript:` uri prefix.

This is what I use to URI escape my scripts so that I can use them in a bookmarklet:

```javascript
prompt(
    "paste data"
).replace(
    /[%#?]/g,
    function(x) {
        return "%" + x.charCodeAt().toString(16);
    }
).replace(
    /\s+/g,
    (" ")
)
```
